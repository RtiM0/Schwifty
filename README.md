# Schwifty [Discontinued]
## A web browser with a unique innovative feature for privacy.
The basic idea is to mirror Google Chrome's spirit with the whole browser based on Android WebView and add a rather unique feature on top of that.
The app basically hides behind a security pattern/pin or preferably biometric security, private data of users and there's no way of knowing if it exists even until the right pattern/pin/biometrics have been detected.
Imagine doing some exclusive research on the interweb wanting to keep it private but also wanting to save it's progress for some other time without letting others even it's existence.
The idea is to add the encrypted hidden data (History, cookies, etc..) back into History, Bookmarks in the app when the data is unlocked.
